# Data Science Class Final Project
## Assessing Crime, Housing, and Employment in New York and Maryland

We aim to investigate the relationship between crime rates and key economic factors such as unemployment and housing prices in the states of New York and Maryland. By delving into our data and employing advanced data science techniques, our project is seeking to analyze the relationship between socio-economic factors and crime data and how this data differs in New York and Maryland. This exploration not only contributes to our understanding of the underlying drivers of crime but also informs evidence-based strategies for promoting community safety and economic well-being.
