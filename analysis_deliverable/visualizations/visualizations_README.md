# Visualization 1 - Correlation Matrix

- Why did you pick this representation? 
A correlation matrix was chosen for its efficiency in displaying the relationships between multiple variables. It allows for quick visual comparison and immediate grasp of the strength and direction of these relationships using color coding, to figure out where to go next in analysis.

- What alternative ways might you communicate the result? 
Alternatives include scatter plot matrices, which provide a more detailed look at the data distribution between variable pairs in the dataset, and network graphs, which visualize the strongest relationships with visual links. Both methods can complement or offer alternative insights beyond the correlation coefficients.

- Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what were they? 
The primary challenge in visualizing correlation matrices is maintaining readability when the number of variables is large as it is in this dataset, which can make the labels and correlation values crowded and hard to read. Additionally, reliance on color to indicate correlation strength can be problematic for color-blind viewers, necessitating careful choice of the color palette.

- Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but it’s recognized which type your visualization is)?
We place this on the poster with a caption saying "Correlation matrix to see which variables in the dataset have any correlation" which should be sufficient for our audience. Adding annotations or a brief summary discussing key findings could also enhance understanding and guide viewers through the data - but there is not room on the poster to do so unfortunately.



# Visualization 2 - Scatter Plot (Agg Assault vs Avg Value)

- Why did you pick this representation? 
A scatter plot was selected to visualize the relationship between Aggravated Assault Rate and Average Housing Value for Maryland and New York, offering a clear view of how these variables correlate differently within each state. The distinct color coding for each state helps in quickly distinguishing the data points, facilitating a comparative analysis.

- What alternative ways might you communicate the result? 
An alternative could be a line graph that shows trends over time since our dataset spans multiple years, allowing viewers to track changes in the assault rate relative to average housing values. Another method could be a heatmap which would show the density of data points, providing visual emphasis on regions of high concentration and potentially revealing patterns or clusters in the data that may be missed in the scatter plot.

- Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what were they? 
One challenge in this visualization is managing the overlap of data points, especially where colors and values are densely packed such as in the bottom left, which can obscure details and make individual data points indistinguishable. Additionally, scaling was an issue as the range of values on each axis is different for each state, which slightly compressed data into tight clusters.


- Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but it’s recognized which type your visualization is)?
This visualization is pretty self-explanatory with the title, axis titles, and legend. We put it on the poster with the statistics tests comparing NY and MD housing and aggressive assault data, so this visualization greatly adds to the analysis.


# Visualization 3 - Double Line Graph (Unemployment and Avg Home Value over time)

- Why did you pick this representation? 
This line graph representation was chosen to depict the trends in unemployment rates alongside average home values over a span of years, allowing for a direct comparison of two different data types over time. Using different colors for each line helps in differentiating between the two variables, making it easier to observe how changes in one might correlate with changes in the other.


- What alternative ways might you communicate the result? 
Another effective method could be a scatter plot with time as a slider if this were an interactive presentation rather than a poster, allowing the viewer to dynamically observe changes year by year, potentially highlighting specific correlations or trends more interactively. An alternative way to communicate these results could be through a dual-axis chart, where one axis represents the unemployment rate and the other represents home values, which would prevent overlap and provide a clearer view of both trends. 


- Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what were they? 
One challenge in visualizing these results is the significant overlap and density of county lines, particularly in the middle years where both data sets show considerable fluctuation, which can make it difficult to trace individual year trends clearly. The use of two vastly different scales on a single graph also creates a visual complexity that can be misleading or confusing without careful inspection - which was a risk we had to take when wanting to visualize the trends of two very differently scaled variables.


- Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but it’s recognized which type your visualization is)?
This visualization on the poster goes with the independence test between unemployment rate and the average housing to show just how correlated the two variables are. It is pretty self-explanatory with the colors, titles, and axes, especially with the test described. It would have been nice to have more room on the poster to analyze the graph in more detail.
